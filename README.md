- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joshua Jameson-Wallis!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Front-end web development and transfering those skills onto my jailbroken iPhone, which I'm sure will die on me one day :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and SASS, with a heavy focus on writing accessible HTML.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me either via email at josh.jamesonwallis@gmail.com, or on my mobile at 07884400668 (yes, that is actually my number).
