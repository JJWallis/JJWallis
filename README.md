- Hey, I’m Josh!
- I’m interested in Front-end web development and learning from any developer who is willing to give me their time.
- I’m currently learning React, Next.js, Google Firebase and TailWind CSS. 
- Feel free to check out my blog where I talk about everything I've learnt: https://jjwallis.bearblog.dev/  
- You can reach me via email at josh.jamesonwallis@gmail.com, or on my mobile at 07884400668 (yes, that is actually my number).
- Have a great day! :)
